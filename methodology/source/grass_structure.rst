Using GRASS GIS
================

---------------------
Setting up GRASS GIS
---------------------

If you are unfamiliar with using GRASS, I suggest you look at the
following tutorials to make sure you have installed and set up a project
on Grass:

-  Step 1 and 2 of the the guide written by Doug Newcomb and Paul Lang
   for a session in the Advanced GIS training for the U. S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service (CSP7300) in 2015:
   https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Introduction_to_GRASS_GIS_with_terrain_analysis_examples

-  An excellent introductory guide on using GRASS GIS for
   Geomorphologists by Andrew Wickert back in 2012:
   https://ma.ellak.gr/documents/2015/07/grass-gis-for-geomorphologists-an-introductory-guide-2.pdf

-----------------------------------
Starting a new Project in GRASS GIS
-----------------------------------

Create a new project location, convention is to use the projected zone
*e.g. 37n* and a location title to describe the project *e.g. italy*.
Click *‘next’* and tick the box for *‘Read projection and datum terms
from a georeferenced data file option’* which will pull the projection
information from metadata. There are lots of other options for
projection of raster data which you can explore. Click *‘next’* and
upload your projected dem. Once you’ve done this and click *‘next’* you
will see a summary of your selection and corresponding projections.
Click *‘Finish‘* to finalise your selection. A pop up window may appear
asking if you want to set the default region. Click *‘no’* as the
bounding box and resolution will be imported from the raster dem.

Time to start your GRASS session – with your GRASS Location and Mapset
*‘PERMANENT’* highlighted, click on *‘Start your GRASS session’*. GRASS
will load up a graphical user interface (GUI) using two windows - a
layer manager and map display. You are now ready to use GRASS. 

The following instructions will use the command line interface but this can
all be done through the GUI if you prefer this method.

-------------------
Enabling Extensions
-------------------

For various of the *r.stream.\** modules, it is necessary to use 
*g.extension* to install these tools as add-ons. The following add-ons 
are needed for stream network analysis:

.. code:: bash

   GRASS :~ > g.extension r.stream.extract r.stream.basins

**Troubleshooting.** If you get an error *‘Please install GRASS
development package‘*, you can install the package from the Linux command line
using *sudo apt install grass-dev*. Then try re-installing the add-ons.

---------------
Useful Commands
---------------

To check the list of rasters or vector files generated during the
hydrological analysis, use:

.. code:: bash

   GRASS :~ > g.list raster
   GRASS :~ > g.list vector

Another useful tool to check metadata of the raster or vector layer –
which will also tell you what tool and criteria you used to generate the
raster layer is ‘r.info raster’.

.. code:: bash

   GRASS :~ > r.info rasterfilename
   GRASS :~ > v.info vectorfilename

Grass structure

   :alt: Grass internal file structure

   GRASS :~ > Grass internal file structure

GRASS has a strict hierarchy for storing data. The "GISBASE" is the 
master folder where all grass related projects is stored. A "LOCATION" is usually 
defined by a coordinate system, map projection or geographical boundary. GRASS 
will automatically set up the file directory for each new Location. Each Location can have multiple "MAPSETS" which is used to store maps 
for related projects or subregions. However if working as a team on the same 
project, it can also be useful to support simultaneous access for multiple user. 
The 'PERMANENT' mapset can only be modified or removed by the owner. Since GRASS 
has a strict set-up to internally manage its file structure system, make sure that any files are added or deleted from within the GRASS directory.

GIS Data types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Raster.* Raster data is a regulary spaced grid (i.e. digital elevation model) and region settings are used to  determine the spatial extent and resolution of the grid. 

*Vector.* Vector maps are series of point (coordinates), lines, polygons or volumes (or any combination of these). Typically each feature in a map will be tied to set of attributes layers stored in a database. The data structure of a vector map *<some_vector>* is stored in the directory *$MAPSET/vector/<some_vector>*. This directory normally contains the files listed below.


.. table:: GRASS Vector data structure

    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /head | ASCII file with header information;                   |
    |       | this is more or less the stuff that v.info displays   |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /dbln | ASCII file that link(s) to attribute table(s)         |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /hist | ASCII file with vector map change history.            |
    |       | v.info -h can be used to display this file            |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /coor | binary file for storing the coordinates               |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /topo |binary file for topology                               |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+
    | /cidx | binary category index                                 |
    +-------+-------------------------------------------------------+

    
Sqlite database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GRASS will automatically create an SQLite database. To browse a table stored in a database within a current mapset, you can use *sqlitebrowser* as a convenient SQLite front-end browser. 

.. code:: bash

    # fetch GRASS variables as shell environment variables:
    GRASS :~ > eval `g.gisenv`
    # use double quotes:
    GRASS :~ > sqlitebrowser "$GISDBASE/$LOCATION_NAME/$MAPSET"/sqlite/sqlite.db
